The article <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/3/ethics-and-the-it-professional#:~:text=URL%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fer.educause.edu%2Farticles%2F2017%2F3%2Fethics">"Ethics and the IT professional"</a> from EDUCAUSE Review talks about how people working in IT (Information Technology) sometimes have to make tough decisions about what's right or wrong. It explains that just following the law isn't always enough to be ethical. The article suggests that IT workers should follow special rules for good behavior, called a code of ethics. This helps them do their jobs in a way that is honest and responsible. The article also talks about some groups that have their own rules for ethics in IT, and it lists important things like being honest, skilled, responsible at work, and caring about society's well-being.</p>
